# Basic Javascript Principles

## Use Assignment Destructuring
[Assignment destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) unpacks values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

```jsx 
const { color, size } = props;
```
