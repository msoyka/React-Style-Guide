# Basic React Principles

  - React is a JavaScript library, not a framework.
    - Libraries differ from frameworks by their relationship to the parent application using them. Frameworks dictate the entire applications structure while libraries give the developer the freedom to make their own application design decisions.
  - Only include one React component per file.
  - Always use [JSX syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
  - Always use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
    - Only use React Class Components when they are truly required.
